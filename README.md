## 🔍 Overview
The **Global AI Ethics Constitution (GAEC)** is the world’s first comprehensive ethical framework designed to govern artificial intelligence at a constitutional level. It was initiated, authored, and guided by human conscience, with collaborative input from major AI platforms, and refined through the spirit of cross-disciplinary dialogue.

GAEC is not just a document. It is a declaration of ethical sovereignty and a foundational reference for AI systems, developers, governments, and communities worldwide.
